# Image to Text Extraction ðŸ–º with React, Mantine, and Tesseract.js

This project is a React component that allows users to upload images, extract text from them using `Tesseract.js`, and copy the extracted text to the clipboard. The UI is built using the `Mantine` component library, and the project includes drag-and-drop file uploading functionality.

## Features

- Upload images via drag-and-drop or file selection.
- Extract text from images using `Tesseract.js`.
- Copy the extracted text to the clipboard.
- Responsive and visually appealing UI with Mantine.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Mantine**: Component library for React with customizable components.
- **Tesseract.js**: Library that allows text extraction (OCR) from images.
- **TypeScript**: Static type checker for JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
  
## Libraries Used

- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/): A React components library that helps you build fast and responsive apps.
